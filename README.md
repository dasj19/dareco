dareco: danish regex collection - a collection of regex patterns that match danish data

The goal of this repository is to gather a collection of regexes that can
tackle danish data formats while searching for or validating data.

The regexes will be split by use case into: end-user format, stored format and validation format.

* End-user format would match data that end-users will see.
* Stored format is meant for databases and other storage mechanisms.
* Validation format will focus not just on the range of allowed values but on the range of valid values.
